# Overview

<p align="justify">
This repository hosts an innovative chatbot solution that intelligently manages and streamlines the process of resolving diverse administrative procedures. Powered by advanced language models, the chatbot ensures smooth navigation through complex tasks, ensuring an intuitive and user-friendly experience for all users.

# Methodology

<p align="justify">
Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) represents an innovative paradigm that harnesses the combined strengths of the ChatGPT API, LangChain, and Weaviate. This sophisticated integration facilitates a seamless amalgamation of information retrieval and content generation, resulting in outputs that are not only accurate and coherent but also infused with creativity and depth. By capitalizing on the individual capabilities of each component, RAG effectively bridges the gap between data-driven precision and the art of nuanced communication, catering to a diverse spectrum of user requirements and preferences.
